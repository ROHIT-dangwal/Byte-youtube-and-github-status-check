Hi, I’m Rohit Dangwal, a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, New Delhi. I developed a strong interest in web development, particularly frontend, during my first year. However, while working on this project, I discovered the true potential of backend development. Throughout this experience, I’ve gained valuable knowledge in authentication and working with YouTube and GitHub APIs.”
In this project i have basically check if a authenticated user is following Byte society github and youtube page or not.I have taken the help of authentication middleware passport.js ,googleauth20 and githubauth2 .
So, the basic idea is to authenticate the user using github or youtube and then check if Byte is present in the user followered  or subscribed list.
After that i have also deployed the project on render. It is very basic , free and easy to use deployement facility for beginners.
My project is live at https://byte-youtube-and-github-status-check.onrender.com   check it out.
